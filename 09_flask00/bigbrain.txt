K09 -- Simple Path to Greatness/We answered questions about a sample flask application prior to testing it, then reflected on our answers
2020-10-06

Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
We haven't seen the exact syntax (__name__) in other languages such as Java and C. Upon doing some research, we learned that that syntax 
dynamically grabs the file name. In line 2, essentially what we are doing is storing the file name in a variable. This can also be
done in other languages, but the syntax varies. For example, in Java you might use Path getFileName().

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
We have seen the forwardslash in filepaths to show the exact location of an item. It's used to separate the folders to make it
easier for the user. It's similarly used in website URLs. 

Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
This will print to the webpage that gets served by the flask app. It will print the filename (in this case, app.py).

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
It will appear below the printed filename. We're not sure, but we made an educated guess.

Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
In Java, app is the object and run is a method belonging to that object. By writing app.run(), you call that method.

Post-Running the Flask app:
Although the webpage functioned mostly according to our expectations, we were incorrect about Q2. We had thought that it would print the name of
the file on the webpage, but only "No hablo queso!" showed up. This suggests that if you want something to be printed onto the page, you must return 
it rather than printing.
