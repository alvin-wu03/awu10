Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
render_template is a function you are importing so if you don't import it you 
will not be able to serve the html page on the site - it will return an error

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template

Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
The first argument is referring to the template that is being rendered by the app
The second argument gets passed into the template as the title of the page
The third argument is the list that gets passed into the template and is printed in the body of the page

Q/C/C
- What is the difference between the "{" and "{{" 
-- Single "{" are for conditional statements and "{{" is for pther Jinja code within the HTML
- Does render_template have any other potential parameters besides the template name and the variables that 
  get passed into it
-- You can have unlimited variables to pass but there aren't any other parameters
- How does the template know which part of the Jinja code is a variable

Predictions
- The home page (url: http://127.0.0.1:5000/) is going to have "No hablo queso!" printed on it
- The page at (url: http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template) will be the rendered template
    - The title of the page will be retrieved from the app.py (in this case it will be "fooooo")
    - The body of the page will be a list of items separated by new lines retrieved from the app.py 
    (in this case 0/1/1/2/3/5/8 where the "/" indicate a new line)

Results
- All of our predictions were correct
