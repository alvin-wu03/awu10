K11 -- Some Things Never Change
2020-10-13

Notes:
- The 01_flask-static folder contains a flask app and a static folder, which contains the two foo files
- The flask app and static folder are on the same tree level
- There's no reference to the static folder in the app.py

Predictions:
- To access foo and foo.html we will need to specify the file path in the url (starting from the static folder)
- The foo and foo.html files have different extensions and as such would have different urls even though they have the same name
- If the url is just "http://127.0.0.1:5000/static" then we would get an error because static is not a file that can be served by the app,
  and we did not provide an @app.route decorator for it either
- At the url "http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/foo.html" we would see the page created by the foo.html file
- At the url "http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/foo" we would see the contents of the txt file

Results:
- All of our predictions except the last one were correct
- When at the url "http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/foo", the foo file was automatically downloaded instead of being displayed
- When the url was changed to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/foo.txt" however, the file was served up and it's contents were displayed
