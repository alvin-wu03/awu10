-JSON vs BSON 
	-BSON is faster than JSON
	-BSON has more data support than JSON
-You can convert the two types by importing and exporting data
-To query the data, you need to select a db and then give it parameters to search for using the find command
-The order is (show collections) (use <collection>) (db.<colname>.find({<"key":value>})
